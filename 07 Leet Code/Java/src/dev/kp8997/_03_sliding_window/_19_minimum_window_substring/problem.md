# Minimum Window Substring

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window*** ***substring**** of *`s`* such that every character in *`t`* (**including duplicates**) is included in the window*. If there is no such substring, return *the empty string *`&quot;&quot;`.



The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.



 


Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = &quot;ADOBECODEBANC&quot;, t = &quot;ABC&quot;
**Output:** &quot;BANC&quot;
**Explanation:** The minimum window substring &quot;BANC&quot; includes &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, and &#39;C&#39; from string t.

```



Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = &quot;a&quot;, t = &quot;a&quot;
**Output:** &quot;a&quot;
**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.

```



Example 3:**



```

**Input:** s = &quot;a&quot;, t = &quot;aa&quot;
**Output:** &quot;&quot;
**Explanation:** Both &#39;a&#39;s from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one &#39;a&#39;, return empty string.

```



 


**Constraints:**




	- `m == s.length`

	- `n == t.length`

	- `1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 105`

	- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
