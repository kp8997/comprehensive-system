# Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.



Return *the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations*.



 


Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = &quot;ABAB&quot;, k = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Replace the two &#39;A&#39;s with two &#39;B&#39;s or vice versa.

```



Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = &quot;AABABBA&quot;, k = 1
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Replace the one &#39;A&#39; in the middle with &#39;B&#39; and form &quot;AABBBBA&quot;.
The substring &quot;BBBB&quot; has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.
```



 


**Constraints:**




	- `1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 105`

	- `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.

	- `0 &lt;= k &lt;= s.length`
